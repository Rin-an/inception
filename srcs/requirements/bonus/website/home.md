For now here are some random facts that ,as you guessed, were generated from chatbot :D
-The average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute.
-Honey never spoils. It can last indefinitely.
-Bees communicate with each other by dancing.
-The shortest war in history lasted only 38 to 45 minutes.
-A group of frogs is called an army.
